## What's going on here
Under construction (July 2021)! I am rewriting this (2019) Zumtum app from JS into PHP/Symfony. 
## This is a [study app](https://atom-box.github.io/quanta/):
1. Screen 1: The user drops in a text and presses a button.
2. Screen 2: The text is broken into chunks along the right side of the page.  Matching text-entry forms on the left allow the user to type in questions.
3. Screen 3: The original text disappears.  The user has only their self-written questions (now uneditable) on the left.  On the right, a 2000 character (300 word) text-entry form allows the user to type their paragraph that answers the questions. <br> 
This is the familiar 1-2-3 of Cornell notes, applied to reading of news or text, chosen by the user.
