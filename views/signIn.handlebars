<h5>This site is just a personal project for now.  In the short-term I have no plans to monetize this site.  Maybe if enough people ever found this site helpful and it could grow large enough to need revenue to pay for bandwith or memory.  If that happened I would look at revenue models. *None* of those revenue models will ever sell your metadata, anonymized or not, nor your email address.  <br>I'm ardently pro-privacy.  This is primarily a project to get better at building web apps.  Secondarily I am building it for my own use as a note-taking method.
