This site is just a personal project for now.  In the short-term I have no plans to monetize this site.  Maybe if enough people ever found this site helpful and it could grow large enough to need revenue to pay for bandwith or memory.  If that happened I would look at revenue models. *None* of those revenue models will ever sell your metadata, anonymized or not, nor your email address.  <br>I'm ardently pro-privacy.  This is primarily a project to get better at building web apps.  Secondarily I am building it for my own use as a note-taking method.

### What is zunthum?
Zunthum is free.  I built it for myself.  You are welcome & encouraged to use it. <br>Start by taking something you would like to memorize, like notes, or an article.  Zunthum will guide you in turning it into a series of questions that summarize the main points.  It will then ask you to synthesize a paragraph that answers your series of questions.  <br> This method of studying is called 'Cornell Notes' since it was promoted by a professor at Cornell College going all the way back to the 1940s. Today it is promoted by AVID Schools, a network of over 700 public & private schools based in Sandy Ego, California.  This technique is not an orthodoxy but rather just a trick to get you to view a set of ideas in a layered, structured, timed way.  By giving you a simple set of steps it helps you relax and enjoy learning.
